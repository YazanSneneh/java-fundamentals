* This repository is about java labs for 10 labs.
* Each lab will be in seperate file named by what are the things inside the file.
* Each lab will have section in this document explain what solutions I have created.
* **Note:** all labs will be initialized using gradle, and if I don't I will add which app was created without it bew this line.
* To test each lab run `./gradle test` command.


* I created solution to following and tested them:
## class 01
 * pluralize
    * Explination : a method accepts a word and a number.
    * returns a string with the word pluralized with an “s” if the number is zero, or greater than one. 
 * Flipping Coins function :
    * a method take N number and flip coin, will keep flipping until i get head N times.
    * then print : It took 4 flips to flip 1 head in a row.
 * Clock function:
    * a method that when it's called will print the time every second until someone stop it. 
 * **Testing code in main method**.

## class 02;

* Roll Dice:
  * accepts an integer n and rolls a six-sided dice n times.
  *  The method return an array containing the values of the rolls.

* Contains Duplicates:
  * returns true or false depending on whether the array contains duplicate values. 
* Calculating Averages:
  * accepts an array of integers and calculates.
  * returns the average of all the values in the array.
 
* Array of arrays:
  * calculate the average value for each array inside array of arrays.
  * return the array with the lowest average. 

#  class lab 03
* weather function:
  *  Iterate through all of the data to find the min and max values.
  *   Use a HashSet of type Integer to keep track of all the unique temperatures seen.
  *   iterate from the min temp to the max temp and create a String containing any temperature not seen during the month. 
  *   Return String.

* tallying function:
  * accepts a List of Strings representing votes.
  * returns one string to show what got the most votes.
* linter application and associated tests to catch all errors.

  * reads a JavaScript file with a given Path.
  * generates an error message whenever it finds a line that doesn’t end in a semi-colon.
